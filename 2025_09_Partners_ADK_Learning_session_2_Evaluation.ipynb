        "This final code block brings everything together. It runs our evaluation by systematically comparing the agent's performance against the \"answer key\" we created in `evaluation.test.json`.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s the process:\n",
        "1.  **Load Data**: It opens and reads the `evaluation.test.json` file.\n",
        "2.  **Setup Runner**: It uses the `Runner` from the ADK, which is the engine for executing agent interactions.\n",
        "3.  **Loop Through Cases**: The code iterates through each test case from the JSON file.\n",
        "4.  **Run Query**: For each case, it sends the `user_content` (the query) to our agent.\n",
        "5.  **Compare Results**: It takes the agent's final text response (`actual`) and compares it directly to the `final_response` from our file (`expected`).\n",
        "6.  **Display Report**: Finally, it prints a clean report showing which tests `PASSED` and which `FAILED`.\n",
        "\n",
        "If all tests pass, congratulations! 🎉 You've successfully built, tested, and evaluated your first AI agent."
